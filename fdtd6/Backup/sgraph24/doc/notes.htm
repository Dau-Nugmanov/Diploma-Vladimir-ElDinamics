<h3><a NAME="Axis limits"></a>Axis limits</h3>

<p>The Tsp_Axis has properties and method to control axis limits.</p>

<p><tt>property <strong>Min</strong> : double</tt> <br>
<small>Min is the lowest value an axis</small><br>
<tt>property <strong>Max</strong> : double</tt> <br>
<small>Max is the highest value an axis</small> <br>
<tt>procedure <strong>SetMinMax</strong>(m1,m2:double);</tt><br>
<small>Used to set Min and Max at once. The minimal value of the m1 and m2 will be
assigned to the  Min and maximal to the Max.<br>
</small><tt>procedure <strong>MoveMinMax</strong>(aDelta:double); </tt><br>
<small>Used to change Min and Max on value of aDelta with 'frozen' ticks position.The aim
is to permit smooth scroll of plot, without ticks jumps. Procedure is especially useful
for the program which emulates transient recorder. </small><br>
<tt>property <strong>AutoMin</strong> : boolean default False</tt> <br>
<small>The AutoMin property controls if axis will adjust the Min value automatically to
based on the minimum value of its associated data series.</small><br>
<tt>property <strong>AutoMax</strong> : boolean</tt> <br>
<small>The AutoMax property controls if axis will adjust the Max value automatically to
based on the maximum value of its associated data series.</small></p>

<p>There are some <U>features</U>. Suppose we try to set new value to the Min, while this 
value greater then current Max, this value will be assigned to the Max instead of Min. If 
then you set new value to Max you will have incorrect Min value (Min value did not 
changed). To avoid this problem, use <tt>SetMinMax</tt> method, if you want to assign
arbitrary values to the Min and Max at once. Notice, changing properties Min or/and Max 
will reset the AutoMin or/and AutoMax to False.</p> 
<p>The axis limits also changed after zooming or panning of the plot by the mouse
(z&amp;p). This processes did not change AutoMin and AutoMax. Shift+Click on the plot will
restore limits after z&amp;p if properties Min and Max was not changed by another way
after z&amp;p.</p>

<h3><a Name="Data series"></a><a> Data series </h3>

<p>There are no many kinds of data series. But you can write it yourself, and they will
match your needs. Inherit it from Tsp_DataSeries component and implement 1 procedure and 4
functions: <br>
 <tt>procedure <b>Draw</b>; virtual; </tt><br>
 <tt>function <b>GetXMin</b>(var V:double):boolean; virtual;</tt> <br>
 <tt>function <b>GetXMax</b>(var V:double):boolean; virtual;</tt> <br>
 <tt>function <b>GetYMin</b>(var V:double):boolean; virtual;</tt> <br>
 <tt>function <b>GetYMax</b>(var V:double):boolean; virtual;</tt> <br>
<tt><strong>Draw</strong></tt> procedure called by parent plot to draw series. In this
procedure you place code which </a><a HREF="#Custom draw">draws your data on plot</a>
DCanvas. <b><tt>Get?Min</tt></b> and <b><tt>Get?Max</tt></b> functions are used by parent
plot during auto scaling process. In this procedures you can find minimal or maximal value
of your data and assign it to variable V. Function must return True if they set valid
value to the V, otherwise they must return False. For example if data series has no data
you cannot set valid value to the V. <br>
There is also procedure which is reserved to draw Legends of the plot series.<br>
<tt>procedure <b>DrawLegendMarker</b>(const LCanvas:TCanvas, MR:TRect); virtual;</tt> <br>
It should paints series marker (for example line and point marker image) on LCanvas using
rectangle  MR. Of course you should also implement data storage which are drawn by
series.<font SIZE="-1"> </font>See sgr_data.pas and sgr_def.hlp for more details. <br>
If you agree to store data in variant array there is more simple way. Derive Data Series
from Tsp_XYDataSeries. See how Tsp_XYLine and Tsp_SpectrLines were derived from Tsp_XYDataSeries in sgr_data.pas. Both class inherited data storage interface from Tsp_XYDataSeries but implemented different data presentation on plot. Tsp_XYLine.Draw procedure paints lines between data points and/or points markers. <BR>
On other side if you need XYLine data presentation, but want to have another data storage then derive your series from Tsp_DrawPoints. The simplest way is to use <A HREF="edseries.htm">Tsp_ndsXYLine</A>   </p>

<h3><a name="Plot markers"></a>Plot markers</h3>

<p>Some times I need mark visually some points on plot. First I use OnDrawField and OnDrawEnd
handlers, but now I implements plot marker. There are Tsp_LineMarker and Tsp_ImageMarker
in the current version. Tsp_LineMarker draws &quot;infinite&quot; vertical or horizontal
line. For example to show X=0 and Y=0 lines as quasi axis you can create 2 LineMarker
of vertical and horizontal type with Position=0.0. In this case you will have two line on
plot field. One from the top to bottom at X=0 and second from the left to right at Y=0.
 Tsp_ImageMarker can be used to mark point and so on. Notice one exotic way to use
it as background map under trajectory of motion (of course trajectory is given by data series). It can be done with Tsp_ImageMarker, place it and assign Picture property metafile with map image, set property WhenDraw =dmBeforeSeries and you will have background image which is scaled and moved same as data.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Plot drawing"></a>Plot drawing</h3>

<p>Plot has 2 areas - Field and Around Area. Field is area surrounded by 4 axis. The data
series are painted on the Field. The axis caption, ticks and ticks label are painted on
the Around Area.</p>

during operation selected by color custom draw procedures are called. </p>

<p><a name="Custom draw"><strong>Custom draw rules</strong></a><br>
This rules apply for Data Series Draw procedure and OnFieldDraw, OnDrawEnd and
OnDrawCustomPoint event handlers. They must<br>
 use DCanvas to draw<br>
 use DWidth as plot width, DHeight as plot height <br>
 do not change MapMode or Clipping Region of the DCanvas<br>
 do not change plot Font property<br>
<br>
<strong>Custom draw tips</strong><br>
Use FieldRect if you need to know Field position on the plot image.<br>
Use P2V and V2P axis methods to convert position to value and back.<br>
</p>

<h3><a NAME="Print"></a>Plot print</h3>

<p>There is no special print method of component. You can draw plot on the printer canvas
using method<strong> DrawPlot(</strong>CC : TCanvas; W, H : integer<strong>)</strong> and
of course you would create user interface to control how to print plot. But there is
special dialog form (<u>sgr_sprint.pas</u>) in sgr_demo program. You can look it as
example of plot printing through metafile and simple preview. Note that it is important to
set true-type font to Font property for correct print scaling.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Real Time"></a>Real Time Graphing </h3>

<p>The Tsp_XYPlot and Tsp_XYLine have special features to help data graphing in real time
or to suppress flickering. This features are: <br>
 property Tsp_XYPlot.<strong>BufferedDisplay</strong> <br>
 procedure Tsp_XYDataSeries.<strong>AddXYArrays</strong>(pX,pY:pointer; n:integer); <br>
 property Tsp_XYDataSeries.<strong>LockInvalidate</strong> <br>
 procedure Tsp_XYLine.<u><strong>QuickAddXY</strong>(aX,aY:double)</u>; </p>

<p>If data rate is relatively slow (&lt;10 1/sec) it simplest way set BufferedDisplay=True
to draw plot throughout internal buffer and have flicker free paint. To add data point by
point and immediately reflect changes on screen use procedure AddXY(aX,aY:double). This
procedure add values at the end of series data and update Plot (not invalidate but
update!). </p>

<p>If it is not enough, then use procedure AddXYArrays(pX,pY:pointer; n:integer) to add
data by portion of several (n) points. In this case the plot will invalidate only one time
for several (n) points. Notice, there is also property LockInvalidate, set it to True and
use AddXY several times and then set LockInvalidate to&nbsp; False.</p>

<p>At last, to have maximum visualisation data rate, use procedure <font color="#800000">QuickAddXY(aX,aY:double)</font>.
It adds values at end of data storage like AddXY, but does not spend time to update Plot,
instead of that it directly draw next line segment or/and last point, but because of that
the AutoMin and AutoMax are ignored.</p>
