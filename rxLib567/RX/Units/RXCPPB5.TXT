C++Builder 5.x:

Put all source files from this archive into RX\Units directory.

Uninstall previous installed version of RX Library from C++Builder IDE.
Remove previously compiled RX packages (if any) RXCTL5.BPL, RXDB5.BPL,
RXBDE5.BPL, DCLRX5.BPL, DCLRXDB5.BPL and DCLRXBD5.BPL from your hard disk.

Be sure that linker option "Use dynamic RTL" is unchecked.
Use "File\Open..." menu item of C++Builder IDE to open RX' runtime
package RXCTL5.BPK. Then use "Project\Make..." or "Project\Build..." menu
item to compile package RXCTL5.BPK. After compiling repeat that consistently
for each of the other RX Library packages (.BPK files) RXDB5.BPK,
RXBDE5.BPK, DCLRX5.BPK, DCLRXDB5.BPK and DCLRXBD5.BPK (be sure to keep
the sequence mentioned). For runtime packages (RXCTL5, RXDB5 and RXBDE5)
put compiled BPL files into directory that is accessible through the search
PATH (DOS envirounment variable, not IDE search path; for example, in the
Windows\System directory). After compiling RX packages you must install RX
design-time packages into the C++Builder IDE.

Use "Component\Install packages..." menu item to open "Packages" dialog
box. Then click "Add..." button and locate DCLRX5.BPL in the directory
specified as your BPL output directory (it is $(BCB)\Projects\Bpl by default)
and click "OK" to install package into IDE. After installing DCLRX5 package
install DCLRXDB5 and DCLRXBD5 packages as above.
